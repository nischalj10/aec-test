# Changes from the main Opus branch

This repository performed a number of minor changes on the Opus sourcecode
to port it onto the ESP32, in order to comply with its component based
build system.

## Added files:
- A component.mk was added to register these source files as new component.
This component file adds all necessary source folders and include paths, as
well as defining some local compiler options.

## Removed files:
- All build files and original makefiles have been removed. They can not
be used with the ESP32 build system, and cluttered the files a bit. It's
also not necessary to provide a standalone build option for this component.
- Any platform-specific optimizations have been removed. This is due to them
being incompatible with the ESP32 hardware, which sadly does not include
any kind of hardware optimizations that can be used for Opus.
- The Testing files have been removed. They have not been added to the ESP32.
Perhaps in the future someone could write tests to verify that the ESP32
behaves properly, however so far everything seems functional.
